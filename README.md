This is a project I did while first learning to code. I did it as part of the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum.

In this project, I learned typography & how to style your text to be easily readable and suit its purpose.
  I built a nutrition label webpage. I learned how to style text, adjust line height, and position your text using CSS.
